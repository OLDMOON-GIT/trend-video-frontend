[2025-11-16 04:58:27]  ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
[2025-11-16 04:58:27]  We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\oldmoon\workspace\package-lock.json as the root directory.
[2025-11-16 04:58:27]  To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
